First attempt to create dashboard displaying all important informations like calendar, weather, news etc. 
Currently it's working on raspberry pi exactly like that: https://www.instagram.com/p/99ACWOG9tH/?taken-by=piogrek

You can see demo here http://dash.dev.dothome.co.uk/ 

It's also my way of learning AngularJs, so the code will be improved

Personal goal: make everyone at home look at the dashboard (mirror) and read what it has to say on a daily basis :)

Near features:
- multi pages controlled by eg. small numeric keyboard - eventually touchscreen
- integrate with smart home centre API to show more data as temperature home/outside, camera view
